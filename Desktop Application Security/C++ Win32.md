# C++ Win32 Applications
### Static Analysis
- Check If binary is signed
```powershell
# Using sysinternals sigcheck check all files in folder
.\sigcheck.exe -s "C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco Systems\Cisco Example Application" > 'C:\work\telecom\Cisco Example Application\sigcheck.txt'

# Using Powershell, More checks than sigcheck but provides 
# Less verbosity
Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco Systems\Cisco Example Application" -Recurse | ForEach-object {Get-AuthenticodeSignature $_.FullName -erroraction 'silentlycontinue'} | Where-Object {$_.status -ne "Valid" -and $_.status -ne "UnknownError"} | fl *
```
 - Check if proper hardening has been applied to binary
[NetSPI/PESecurity: PowerShell module to check if a Windows binary (EXE/DLL) has been compiled with ASLR, DEP, SafeSEH, StrongNaming, and Authenticode. (github.com)](https://github.com/NetSPI/PESecurity)
```powershell
# Import module
Import-Module .\Get-PESecurity.psm1

# Check a directory for DLLs & EXEs recrusively 
Get-PESecurity -directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco Systems\Cisco Example Application"  -recursive | Export-Csv PESecurity.csv

# Txt file output
Get-PESecurity -directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco Systems\Cisco Example Application"  -recursive > .\PESecurity.txt

# Bulk Get POCs for files
Get-PESecurity -directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\Cisco Systems\Cisco Example Application"  -Recursive | Where-Object {$_.ControlFlowGuard -ne "True" } | ForEach-Object {write-output $_.FileName} > 'C:\work\telecom\Cisco Example Application\ControlFlowGuardModules.txt'

## Dynamic Analysis
### Analysis
- Dump Memory and search for data
Using Windows Task Manager, right click the process and click create dump file.

-  Check Loaded DLLs using [Process Explorer - Windows Sysinternals | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)
-   Identify Handles to open files
-  Command Line arguments/Working directory
- Monitor Win32 API calls & Windows Events using [API Monitor: Spy on API Calls and COM Interfaces (Freeware 32-bit and 64-bit Versions!) | rohitab.com](http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor)
-  Monitor Windows Events using [Process Monitor - Windows Sysinternals | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)
> Utilize filters to hone down on intersting events such as read/write events to files that are used during/after authentication/authorization.
- Check registry for clear-text registry writes using [regshot | SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/regshot/)
	1. Use regshot to snapshot the registry before and after any operation that might have written to the registry.
	2. Compare both snapshots for registry changes.

### In Disk/Memory Manipulation
- Modify the binary using [HxD - Freeware Hex Editor and Disk Editor | mh-nexus](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)


### Fuzzing
Fuzz the application using WinAFL  for memory corruption vulnerabilities.

[Fuzzing with WinAFL Writing Harness for a DLL and fuzzing it with WinAFL - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeN3M0sK9GA)

> Writing harness functions might be time-consuming. However, very rewarding once you learn how to do so quickly.


### Traffic Interception
- Is clear text traffic transferred?
- Can you manipulate traffic?

> You can use one or many of these techniques in conjuncture to read/manipulate network traffic. My personal favorite is fiddler to intercept the traffic and forward it to Burp Suite in combination with Burp Suite custom proxy rules to narrow down the traffic to the application specific traffic as much as possible without the noise generated by the OS and other random applications on the host

#### WireShark 
> This can be also used for WinShark

[Decrypt SSL with Wireshark - HTTPS Decryption: Step-by-Step Guide (comparitech.com)](https://www.comparitech.com/net-admin/decrypt-ssl-with-wireshark/)

#### WinShark
> WinShark Makes filtering traffic by process ID possible. Use the `etw.header.ProcessId == 1234` filter. Also, make sure to always run wireshark as admininstrator after installing WinShark

[Wireshark · Go Deep.](https://www.wireshark.org/)
[airbus-cert/Winshark: A wireshark plugin to instrument ETW (github.com)](https://github.com/airbus-cert/Winshark)

1. To capture network traffic using Winshark, you have to simply activate network tracing through netsh:
```batch
netsh.exe trace start capture=yes report=no correlation=no
```

2. And then create an ETW session associated with the Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture provider:
```batch
logman start Winshark-PacketCapture -p "Microsoft-Windows-NDIS-PacketCapture" -rt -ets
```

3. Then launch Wireshark with administrator privileges and select the `Winshark-PacketCapture` interface.

#### MITM Proxy
